** THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY ON HOLD BECAUSE TIME AND OPENGL IS HARD

Temple is for the rapid (graphical) creation of file format templates.

The program will be written with QT and C++. In active development through the year end. This is my first C++ program, take it with some salt.

Feature goals: 
	Implement more types.
	Define a language?
	Display of template over the hexdump of a file.
	Automatic generation of Python from template.

The current types are:
	Byte*
	Word*
	Double Word*
	Quad Word*
	String
		Requires either a length specifier or a terminator.
	Variable Length
		Same as String?
	Fixed Value
		Magic number sort of deal. A value that should always be the same.
	Unknown Chunk
		Binary blob.
	*Implemented

The meta types (ie: applied to the types) are:
	Length
		Marks a variable as the length of another.
	Count
		Marks a variable as the count of a set of variables.
	Switch
		Marks a variable as a switch for some set of variables or groups. 
		(Think switch / case.)
	Group
		Some group of variables.
	Signed
	Unsigned
	Big Endian
	Little Endian
	Terminator
		Identifies the terminating character of a variable length chunk.
		
I believe these types will allow the parsing of most file formats. Please notify me of any conditions they would not meet.
