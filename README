Temple is for the rapid (graphical) creation of file format templates.

The program will be written with QT and C++. In active development through the year end. This is my first C++ program, please notify me of any glaring errors.

Feature goals: 
	Graphical file format template building.
	Display of template over the hexdump of a file.
	Automatic generation of Python from template.

The current types are:
	Byte
	Word
	Double Word
	Quad Word
	String
		Requires either a length specifier (can be another variable) or a terminator.
	Variable Length
		Same as String?
	Fixed Value
		Magic number sort of deal. A value that should always be the same.
	Unknown Chunk
		Binary blob.

The meta types are (ie: applied to the types):
	Length
		Marks a variable as the length of another.
	Count
		Marks a variable as the count of a set of variables.
	Switch
		Marks a variable as a switch for some set of variables or groups. (Think switch / case.)
	Group
		Some group of variables.
	Signed
	Unsigned
	Big Endian
	Little Endian
	Terminator
		Identifies the terminating character of a variable length chunk.
		
I believe these types will allow the parsing of most file formats. Please notify me of any conditions they would not meet.
